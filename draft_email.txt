Dear George,

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback about your recent visit to our resort. I'm so sorry to hear that the weather didn't quite live up to your expectations. I can imagine how frustrating it must be to experience cloudy and overcast skies when you're looking forward to a sunny getaway.

I must say, I love the idea of your song title "Here comes the sun but it never came" - it's a great way to capture the sentiment! I can assure you that we take all feedback seriously and are always looking for ways to improve our guests' experiences.

Regarding the weather in Vientiane in June, our research indicates that it's typically hot and humid with a tropical savanna climate. The average high temperature is around 33째C (91째F), while the average low temperature is around 24째C (75째F). Unfortunately, June is also the start of the wet season, which means there are usually around 16 rainy days throughout the month. This might explain the cloudy and overcast skies you experienced during your visit.

Please know that we value your feedback and appreciate your input. We'll do our best to ensure that our future guests have a better experience. While we can't control the weather, we'll continue to work on providing the best possible services and amenities to make up for any weather-related disappointments.

Thank you again for your feedback, George. We hope to welcome you back to our resort in the future, and we'll do our best to make sure the sun shines brightly for you then!

Best regards,
Sarah, Resident Manager
