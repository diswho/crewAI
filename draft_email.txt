Dear George,

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback about your recent stay at our resort. We apologize that the weather didn't cooperate during your visit, and we understand how frustrating it can be to experience cloudy and overcast skies.

Regarding your question about the typical weather in Vientiane in June, our research suggests that it's a humid and rainy month with high temperatures ranging from 24.9째C (76.8째F) to 31.9째C (89.4째F). Unfortunately, June is one of the wettest months of the year, with an average of 280mm (11.02") of rainfall. However, the longer days with an average of 13h and 12min of daylight can still make for a wonderful stay.

We appreciate your feedback and will take it into consideration for future improvements. We value your opinions and would like to assure you that we're committed to providing the best possible experience for our guests.

Thank you again for your feedback, and we hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back to our resort in the future.

Best regards,
Sarah, Resident Manager
