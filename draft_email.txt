Dear George,

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback about your recent experience at our resort in Vientiane, Laos. We apologize that the weather did not meet your expectations, and we understand how frustrating it can be when the sun doesn't shine.

Regarding your question about the weather in Vientiane in June, our research indicates that June is typically a hot and humid month, with average high temperatures of 33째C (91째F) and average low temperatures of 24째C (75째F). Unfortunately, June also marks the start of the wet season, which may explain the overcast skies you experienced. On average, Vientiane receives around 220 mm (8.7 in) of rainfall throughout the month.

We appreciate your creative idea for a song, "Here comes the sun but it never came" - it's a great reflection of your experience! We're sorry that the weather didn't live up to your expectations, but we hope you can appreciate the unique characteristics of Vientiane's tropical savanna climate.

Thank you again for your feedback, and we hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back to our resort in the future.

Best regards,
Sarah, Resident Manager
