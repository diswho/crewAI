Dear George,

Thank you for taking the time to share your concerns about the weather during your recent stay at our resort. I apologize that it didn't quite live up to your expectations. I can understand why you'd want to write a song called 'Here comes the sun but it never came'!

Regarding your question about the typical weather in Vientiane in June, I can inform you that it's usually warm and humid with average high temperatures ranging from 28째C to 30째C (82째F to 86째F). Unfortunately, June is also the start of the wet season, which means we can expect around 220 mm (8.7 in) of rainfall throughout the month. It's not uncommon to have cloudy and overcast days during this time of the year in Vientiane.

I want to assure you that we value your feedback and appreciate your honesty. I understand that the weather can be unpredictable, and it's likely that the cloudy and overcast days you experienced were related to the time of year and location.

Thank you again for your feedback, and I hope you'll give us another chance to provide you with a better experience in the future.

Best regards,
Sarah, Resident Manager
